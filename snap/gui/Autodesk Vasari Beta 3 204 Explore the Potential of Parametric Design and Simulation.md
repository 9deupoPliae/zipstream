- It enables you to create complex forms and geometries using parametric modeling tools, such as adaptive components, curtain systems, massing, and sketching.
- It allows you to perform various types of analysis on your design, such as energy analysis, solar radiation analysis, wind tunnel analysis, and structural analysis. You can also use the Autodesk Green Building Studio service to access more advanced simulation and optimization tools.
- It supports interoperability with other Autodesk products, such as AutoCAD, Inventor, Fusion 360, and Revit. You can import and export your models in various formats, such as DWG, DXF, IFC, SAT, SKP, and RVT.
- It facilitates collaboration and communication with your team members and stakeholders. You can share your models online using the Autodesk 360 service, or export them to PDF or image formats. You can also use the Autodesk BIM 360 Glue service to coordinate your models with other disciplines.

## Features of Autodesk Vasari Beta 3 204
 
Autodesk Vasari Beta 3 204 has many features that make it a powerful tool for conceptual design and analysis. Some of the main features are:

- The Conceptual Design Environment: This is the main workspace where you can create and modify your models using various tools and commands. You can access different modes of modeling, such as massing mode, curtain system mode, adaptive component mode, or sketch mode. You can also use the properties palette to adjust the parameters and settings of your elements.
- The Analysis Panel: This is where you can perform different types of analysis on your models. You can access the energy settings dialog box to define the location, climate, building type, and occupancy of your project. You can also access the solar radiation settings dialog box to define the orientation, time period, and resolution of your solar analysis. You can also access the wind tunnel settings dialog box to define the wind speed, direction, and turbulence of your wind analysis. You can also access the structural settings dialog box to define the material properties, loads, supports, and constraints of your structural analysis.
- The Results Panel: This is where you can view the results of your analysis in various formats. You can view the energy results in graphs or tables that show the annual or monthly energy consumption, demand, cost, CO2 emissions, and EUI of your project. You can also view the solar radiation results in color-coded maps that show the incident solar radiation on each surface of your model. You can also view the wind tunnel results in vector fields that show the wind velocity and pressure on each surface of your model. You can also view the structural results in diagrams that show the displacement, stress, strain, or force on each element of your model.
- The Project Browser: This is where you can manage your project files and elements. You can create different views of your model, such as floor plans, elevations, sections,
